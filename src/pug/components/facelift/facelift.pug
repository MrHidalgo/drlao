          h2.facelift__title.c-title WHY FACELIFT?
          p.facelift__desc.c-desc As people age, gravity and decreased collagen production cause facial tissues to sag. Droopiness in the face not only results in an aged appearance, it can also cause you to look sad or upset. The most prominent change is the appearance of the jowls, the soft tissue prominence lateral to the chin.
          p.facelift__desc.c-desc At our NYC practice, facelift surgery is an extremely popular procedure. The surgery can reverse the effects of gravity by lifting the tissues of the lower face. With various approaches and techniques, a facelift can also improve the soft tissue contour in the midface and cheek areas. Combining facelift and forehead lifts can effectively rejuvenate the entire face.

              pfacelift__box-desc.c-desc.c-desc--white If your facial concerns are subtler and are concentrated in the lower face and neck, a mini facelift may be the optimal procedure for you. It is a less-invasive treatment than a full facelift. Because of this, patients have a shorter recovery while still achieving a more youthful facial profile and improved neck and jawline contours. It can also be performed using local anesthesia with sedation instead of general anesthesia.
